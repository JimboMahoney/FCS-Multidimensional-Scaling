# FCS-Multidimensional-Scaling
Plots the MDS (Multi-dimensional scaling) of 3 or more FCS files. <br><br>
Useful for comparing the overall similarity / difference between multidimensional FCS files (e.g. those with many parameters).

### Description

Inspired by the Nowicka et al [workflow](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-748), I created a simple script that will perform only the MDS section.
<br>
This was mostly just to practice / learn R and dealing with FCS files and analysis tools that may be useful.

### Usage
Copy / paste and run the script in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and perhaps an IDE such as [R-Studio](https://rstudio.com/)
